        There are several waterfalls among the outstanding nature of the Turgen Mountains in western Mongolia. One of them is Baga Turgen waterfall in Turgen gorge near the western shore of the picturesque Khoton and Khurgan Lakes. The glacier waterfall falls from 36 m cliff and divided into two waterfalls. The bigger waterfall heights 23 m while the smaller one falls from 13 m. The pristine Turgen valley is an ideal place for hiking and has some historical relicts.
The waterfall's isolated location along the country border area and rough roads helped its surroundings remain wild.

          Taikhar Rock is located 22 kilometres (14 miles) northeast from Tsetserleg, in the village of Ikh Tamir, south the Khoid Tamir River. It’s a big 20-metres (66 feet) high granite rock, covered with 150 writings in many different languages and dating back from many different periods (runic, Sogd, Uyghur, Mongolian, Nangiad, Tibetan writings). The oldest one is the runic writing, dating back from the turkish period of the 6th and 7th centuries. An ovoo was placed at its top. Unfortunately, there are many graffiti on this rock and the old writings almost disappeared. The government decided to protect the rock in 1994.

          Legends
          The most famous legend bound to Taikhar rock tells that Bukhbilegt, a giant warrior, threw this rock on a snake that was coming out from the land, which explains its strange presence in this place.
          
          Another local legend tells that this rock symbolizes the love of two unfortunate lovers. Tamir loved a girl, Taikhar, but the local lord, who wanted to marry the beautiful Taikhar, prevented their love. So the girl ran away towards the river and her lover sat near the river to wait for her to come back. But the wait was endless and Tamir ended up becoming a rock, standing along the river for eternity, with no possibility ever to meet up with his love again.

                  The Khalkha or Kalka (Mongolian: Халх, romanized: Halh, Mongolian script:ᠬᠠᠯᠬ᠎ᠠ pronounced [ˈχɑɮχ], Chinese: 喀爾喀) have been the largest subgroup of Mongol people[2] in modern Mongolia since the 15th century. The Khalkha, together with Chahars, Ordos and Tumed, were directly ruled by Borjigin khans until the 20th century; unlike the Oirats, who were ruled by Dzungar nobles or the Khorchins, who were ruled by Qasar's descendants.

                  The two original major Khalkha groups were ruled by the direct male line descendants of Dayan Khan. The Baarin, Khongirad, Jaruud, Bayaud and the O'zeed (Ujeed) became Dayan Khan's fifth son Achibolod's subjects, thus formed the Southern Five Halhs. Seven northern Khalkha otogs: 1 Jalairs, Olkhonud; 2 Besut, Iljigin; 3 Gorlos, Keregut; 4 Khuree, Khoroo, Tsookhor; 5 Khukhuid, Khatagin; 6 Tanghut, Sartuul; 7 Uriankhai[3] became Dayan Khan's youngest (could be third) son Geresenje's (Mongolian: Гэрсэне Жалайр Хан) subjects. Khotogoids are close in culture and language to the Khalkha Mongols.[4]
                  
                  There were also numerous direct descendants of Genghis Khan who had formed the ruling class of the Khalkha Mongols prior to the 20th century, but they were and still also regarded as Khalkha Mongols rather than belonging to a special unit.
                  
                  The Thirteen Khalkhas of the Far North are the major subethnic group of the independent state of Mongolia. They number 1,610,400 (78.8%) of Mongolia's population (1989 figures).
                  
                  The Khalkha or Halh dialect is the standard written language of Mongolia.[5] </p>
